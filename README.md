###

* I started this React Native Employee Manager app by following the instructions from the React Native Udemy course (Stephen Grider instructor)

* Next, I plan to add some more features, feel free to make any contributions

### Potential New Features

* Employee Status/Schedule (clocked in?)
* Employee task list (ie. tickets) - predefined and new
* What task are they doing currently, what has been done?
* Employee Requests
* Google Maps API

### Install

`git clone git@github.com:LawsonDaiki/EmployeeManager.git`
`cd EmployeeManager`
`cd manager && npm install`

* Setup Firebase for Data Storage by user
* A logged-in User can create new Employees.
* A logged-in User can modify/edit Employees.
* A logged-in User can View the List of Employees.
* A logged-in User can delete employees.

### Libraries used:

* React & React Native
